Legal part:
At 05/04/2002 I've changed Version 0.3 of "GKrellM Belkin UPS Plugin" by Chris Page (chris@starforge.co.uk) to be able to connect to NUT.
 The NUT client part I got from the NUT 0.50.0 package.

Requirements:
 * NUT of some version (not sure) + source
 * Supported UPS
 * ln -s /yourNUTsrctree ./nut

TODO:
 * Monitoring of multiple upses/hosts
