At 05/04/2002 I've changed Version 0.3 of "GKrellM Belkin UPS Plugin" by Chris Page (chris@starforge.co.uk) to be able to connect to NUT.
To obtain the source package of "GKrellM Belkin UPS Plugin" goto: http://www.starforge.co.uk/gkrellm/

Requirements:
 * NUT of some version (not sure) + development headers
 * Supported UPS

TODO:
 * Add more monitoring Variables: Teperature, Voltages (battery/output), etc. where supported
 * Multiple UPS status handling
 * Monitoring multiple upses/hosts (far future)
