Description
=-=-=-=-=-=
This plugin communicates with the Belkin Sentry Bulldog "upsd" daemon process 
and displays various pieces of status information:

    * Input, output and battery voltages.
    * Input and output AC frequency.
    * UPS load and temperature.
    * UPS status messages.

Please note that if you do not have a Belkin UPS you should not expect this
plugin to work for you - I have no idea if other UPS manufacturers provide
software even remotely similar to, let alone compatible with, Belkin's
Sentry Bulldog software.


Notes on Mains
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Mains voltages are typically 220 to 240 in the UK, this presented some problems
with fitting any sort of meaningful data on the chart - either the chart is 
prohibitively large or any difference between the signals is swamped by the 
scale. Subtracting a value from the input and output voltages before display 
ensures that both signals will fit on the display without significant loss of 
detail on a 40/50 pixel high monitor. The Mains option in the configuration
should be approximately the same as the UPS low voltage transfer value (187v 
on a UK Belkin UPS). US users will probably want to lower this to 90 or 100v.


Requirements
=-=-=-=-=-=-
To use this plugin you will need:

    * GKrellM 1.2+
    * Belkin Sentry Bulldog software (supplied with your Belkin UPS)

To compile the plugin you will also need the development files for GKrellM
and GTK+.

The Belkin Sentry Bulldog software must be installed and the upsd server
running for this plugin to function correctly. Note that it is possible to
monitor the status of a UPS over a LAN (or even over the internet if you
have a decent connection) so you can use this plugin to monitor the status 
of a UPS on another machine if you want.
