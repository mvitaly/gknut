Important Note
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

    If you are using a UK voltage (230/240v) UPS, you can skip straight to 
the Installation Instructions section below. If you are outside the UK, 
using a 110v/120v UPS then you can either skip straight to the installation 
instructions and set the mains voltage in the plugin configuration or you
can uncomment a line in the Makefile to set the default mains voltage for
you. To do this, load the Makefile in this package into a text editor, 
look for the line that reads

# MAINS_MIN = -DMAINS_MIN=90

and remove the '# ' from the start. ie, so it reads

MAINS_MIN = -DMAINS_MIN=90

Now when you compile the plugin it will compile in a more sensible value
for non-UK UPSs. 


Installation Instructions
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

    This plugin does not yet have an autoconf "configure" script, so for the 
moment installation is simply:

make

If that works without errors then you can do:

make install

This will copy the plugin to the global gkrellm plugins directory so it must
be done as root. If you do not have root permission, or you do not want to
globally install the plugin, do the following instead:

make
cp gkrellmbups.so ~/.gkrellm/plugins/

If make fails please ensure that you have basic compilation tools installed
(gcc, make, etc), gkrellm's development files have been installed and that
you have the development files for GTK+ 1.2 and gdk-imlib (part of the 
Imlib package) installed. 

If all goes well, the plugin should be listed in the Plugins section of the
GKrellM configuration window next time you restart GKrellM.

If you have doxygen installed, you can generate the source documentation
by typing

make documentation

(or just run doxygen in the plugin directory of course...)
